# scripts

Once you have Python3 and pip3 installed:

1) pip3 install PyAutoGUI
2) pip3 install pynput
3) pip3 install keyboard

Open the "teste_jogando" using python IDLE and press F5, or just run the script. It will listen for the 'enter' keyboard key to run the looting method and the 'backspace' key to run the skinning method. To exit the script press 'ESC' or kill the running process closing the python window.

The file "teste" is just a regular click/wait function.
